# CIT 281


**Labs**

[Lab #01](https://tmuns22.github.io/cit281-lab01/)
**Lab #01**
  Installing and setting up your personal computer with the software tools required for this course, practicing using software tools, practicing terminal or shell commands, practicing keyboard shortcuts, and creating your first Node.js server-side JavaScript file.

**Project #01**
  Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders, list the folders in a tree-like structure, use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence, and create and execute a JavaScript file using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug.

**Lab #02**
  Use CLI commands for directory and file manipulation and use CLI commands for git commands.

**Project #02**
  Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo), refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring, and use git via VSCode.

**Lab #03**
  Practice refactoring JavaScript code to use more modern syntax, practice destructuring an object, practice converting normal functions into arrow function expressions, examine using for..in  syntax with objects, practice using for..of syntax with arrays, practice creating a Node.js compatible code module using module.exports, practice importing a Node.js compatible code module using require, examine code using the spread operator.

**Project #03**
  You will be creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, you will then update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.

**Lab #04**
  Create initial Fastify Node.js web server, initialize as a Node.js project folder using Node Package Manager (npm), add Fastify to project using npm, and test using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), add git repo, exclude node_modules folder from git, make commits, fix MIME error, test, and commit, and add a second route with query parameters, test, and commit.

**Project #04**
  You will be creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. You will create all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. You will also create a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb.

**Lab #05**
  Download and install Postman, create a CIT 281 collection and folders, create a Node.js and fastify server application with GET and respond with JSON, add array of students object, use Postman to test server GET routes, add POST handling to server application and respond with JSON, and Use Postman and POST request.

**Project #05**
  For this project, you will create a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain.

**Lab #06**
  Join GitHub and work through Introduction to GitHub course, create lab file, classes overview, create and test Book class, create and test Library class, add at least two more books to the library, and add ISBN and a delete book method.

**Project #06**
  You will be creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class. The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value.

**Lab #07**
  Create your own GitHub organization for the CIT Minor, create your first GitHub repository, clone your GitHub repository to your local system, create lab JavaScript file, and initialize folder as a Node.js folder, Update and commit lab JavaScript file to practice with error handling, and push your changes to GitHub.

**Project #07**
  Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. This Page will be the entry web page for your portfolio. Creating repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class
Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects that provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture. Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects

**Lab #08**
  Create lab file and initialize Node.js folder, install node-fetch package, add fastify starter code, add fastify and node-fetch require statements, and Fetch JSONPlaceholder data.

**Lab #09**
  Create Learning Lab course/repo within your GitHub account, practice exiting and returning to the course from course repo, work through course, and download completed course repo as deliverable.
